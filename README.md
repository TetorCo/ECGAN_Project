# Emoji Creator Project With DCGAN, ECGAN :wave:

My First GAN Project :musical_note:

This is a project I started because I wanted to make a new emoji.

# Over View

ECGAN is a model created based on DCGAN. The model was trained Mac M1 Pro or Colab.

# Results

Because this model is a prototype model, it lacks a lot. :joy:

I hope I can continue to update in the future. :punch:
